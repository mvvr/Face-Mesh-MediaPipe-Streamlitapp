####        MediaPipe offers ready-to-use yet customizable Python solutions as a prebuilt Python package. MediaPipe Python package is available on PyPI for Linux, macOS and Windows.Follow the steps below only if you have local changes and need to build the Python package from source. Otherwise, we strongly encourage our users to simply run pip install mediapipe to use the ready-to-use solutions, more convenient and much faster.
 ###       **Face mesh :**
 ####       The face mesh is a 3D model of a face. It works in combination with the face tracker in Spark AR Studio to create a surface that reconstructs someone's expressions. Once you've added a face tracker and face mesh to your project you can create mask effects, add retouching or change the shape of the face.
         
####         MediaPipe Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.
